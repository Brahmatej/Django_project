While quite a few of those shown the doorwere undoubtedly non-performers, performance alone does not seem to have been the criterion that in†uenced the Prime Minister™s mind. Non-performing  Ministers continue in the cabinet, the most noticeable being the Finance Minister. Also, can the Prime Minister take credit for success in managing the pandemic while sacking the Ministers concerned for their incompetence? The Prime Minister alone has to answer this apparent contradiction. He has also deviated from his oft-repeated doctrine :minimum government-maximum governance, given the mega-sized cabinet. S.K. Choudhury, BengalurunThe Prime Minister  hastargeted non-performance with the removal of key senior Ministers who probably basked in the glory of invincibility. India now has amore inclusive Council of Ministers . Hopefully the inexperience of the new Ministers will give direction to new ideas to realise Mr. Narendra Modi™s vision. Kanak Rajan Nambiar, Varam, Kannur, Kerala nAcabinet expansion in the middle of the Government™s second termhas surprised many . That high-pro“le Ministers who have played a key role since the beginning of the NDA™s rule, have now lost their jobs is intriguing. The Government has also tried to send the right signals in its representation to the educated, the young, women and the socially disadvantaged . But in the team where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the sole leader, the fact is there will hardly be any di‘erence in functioning with the new formations. Dr. D.V.G.Sankararao, Nellimarla, Andhra Pradesh nIn what can be termed a bold initiative and well-timed move, the reshu’e will augur well for the nation. It could have twin bene“ts: the senior guard would really have to be on its toes, andthis is an opportunity for freshers to work on a platform that has been set .Balasubramaniam Pavani, Secunderabad Dilip Kumar It is a matter of honour and pride for both Dilip Kumar and India that he is the only Indian actor to receive the ﬁNishan-e-Imtiazﬂ, one of Pakistan™s highest awards. As reported by the thespian later, during the Kargil war, he was under pressure to return it. His meeting with then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to seek his advice was the turning point Mr. Vajpayee declared: ﬁThere is no doubt about Dilip™s patriotism and commitment to nation...  He has received the Award at an individual level. It™s his will to keep it or return it. No one can pressurise him.ﬂ This it was an occasion when even his opponent could not believe his eyes.For millions of his fans the world over, the immediate reaction was whether this would spell his retirement. Many of us wish that he bounces back and returns to his favourite  turfto make memories turn green for him and his fans.  A.P. Thiruvadi, ChennainFederer™s shocking  defeat is an aberration in his illustrious career. Many of us second what a fan pleaded during the match:  ﬁOne more year, please!ﬂ  Will there be another appearance and one more title win for Federer at Wimbledon? Only he can answer this.  R. Sivakumar, Chennaisingle incident shows the greatness of Mr. Vajpayee as aleader and a human being. One shudders to imagine the situation had it occurred now. Beant Singh Bedi, Mohali, Punjab Wimbledon exit Being an ardent fan of Roger Federer, it waspainful to see the legend bow out of this year™s Wimbledon, and in the quarter “nals.

To read more letters online, scan the QR code Chitrangada Choudhury When an ošcer from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) came to in- terrogate Father Stan Swamy last monsoon, the  Jesuit sociologist, then 83, in turn asked him about police integrity, and why a father- son duo (P. Jayaraj and Bennicks) should die of custodial torture in a Tamil Nadu  police lock-up. It was quintessential Fr. Swamy: un- afraid, outspoken, and question- ing injustice. Fr. Swamy was sent to Taloja Jail in October 2020 in the Bhima Ko- regaon case, where some of his co- accused have now spent more than three years without bail or trial. All have been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Preven- tion) Act (UAPA), a widely misused tool for governments to criminal- ise lawful dissent and hold ideo- logical opponents in prolonged in- carceration. For all the talk by authorities of a terrorist conspira- cy, Fr. Swamy was never interro- gated in nine months of custody. His arrest in the middle of the pan- demic, over two years after the “rst raid on his spartan one-room residence, seems like targeted viciousness. All Indians have dignity, not just the wealthy and the privileged. This belief guided Fr. Swamy ™s life- long concern for justice, as I saw in my interactions with him over the years as a journalist.  Adivasis and loss When he “rst came to West Singhbhum from his native Tiru- chirappalli in Tamil Nadu in the 1970s, living among the Adivasi communities profoundly shaped him. He had told me in an inter- view, ﬁI underwent an awakening, looking at Adivasi values of equali- ty, community, and decision-mak- ing by consensus.ﬂ His work “rmly rejected the prejudice of Adivasi ‚backwardness™, and tirelessly pointed out how violence and dis- possession was pushed down their throats and called development: ﬁAdivasis lived on lands full of min- erals. Others took these out and enriched themselves, but Adivasis did not get anything.ﬂ In a decade-long tenure as Di- rector of Bengaluru™s Indian Social Institute, he trained countless grass-roots activists. He continued this work when he co-founded the Ranchi-based Bagaicha in 2006 Š acentre for research, training and social action dedicated to working with Adivasi and other marginal- ised communities and legally em- powering their struggles for jus- tice and dignity. As long-time friends and colleagues testify, Fr. Swamy wanted it to be a place which the marginalised felt was their own. A statue of Birsa Munda and a megalith with the names of those killed in anti-displacement protests marked Bagaicha™s cen- tral ground. Its one room library contained reports, studies and “les of newspaper cuttings on is- sues such as  forced displacement, hunger deaths, extra-judicial kill- ings and grassroots protests Š a buried history of India™s democracy. Helping hand for undertrials When I “rst met Fr. Swamy in 2013, his team was immersed in ef- forts for poor undertrials in pri- sons across Jharkhand against a raging armed con†ict.  After three years of painstaking research based on prison visits, meeting police ošcials and villagers, and Right to Information Act requests, his team released a report that in- cluded the case studies of over 100 UAPA undertrials. Overwhelming- ly, they were Adivasis and Dalits, and in some cases they had lan- guished in the criminal justice sys- tem for up to 10 years. About 59% of the households of undertrials, the report found, earned under 3,000 per month and were forced to sell assets such as goats to meet bail conditions or legal ex- penses. Fr. Swamy also “led a pu- blic interest litigation on the basis of his team™s “ndings, which is still being heard in the Jharkhand High Court. As he publicly stated before his arrest, he believed that such ef- forts to challenge an unjust status quo led the state to target him. Fr. Swamy™s demise has led to a public outpouring of sadness and anger at the cruelty of our crimi- nal justice system. Ever self-e‘ac- ing, he would have wanted this at- tention not on him but on the resource grabs that continue to in- †ict  staggering violence against Adivasis and other marginalis ed groups, “ll our prisons with peo- ple with little access to justice, and necessitate draconian laws such as the UAPA. To blame ‚the system™ or ‚the government™ for his death is to overlook how we are implicat- ed in this political economy found- ed on dispossession, and the ever- expanding criminalisation of de- mands for social and environmental justice as conspira- cies against the state.  Liberalisation, the oppressed The human rights activist, K. Bala- gopal, had argued that an abiding legacy of liberalisation is the deleg- itimis ation of concern for the op- pressed. This is why a man who strove all his life for solidarity, fra- ternity and justice in real terms stands accused by our government of promoting enmity. And why his death, while foretold, transcends textual analyses of the UAPA, cour- troom proceedings and prison reforms. Fr. Swamy had one chance to appear in court, when a Bombay High Court B ench asked for him to be presented via video-conferenc- ing from Taloja jail on the after- noon of  May 21. Battling multiple ailments including Parkinson™s dis- ease, diminished hearing, and by then COVID-19contracted in pri- son, he  was visibly ailing, but as al- ways full of self-respect.  He told the court that prison conditions were steadily destroy- ing his abilities to read, write and walk, and that he be granted bail to return to Ranchi to be with his own. In rejecting the judges™ sug- gestion that they send him to hos- pital for a few days, Fr. Swamy as-serted his dignity and innocence, and registered a moral protest against being e‘ectively made to serve a death sentence, as an inde- “nitely imprisoned undertrial. As now well known, a dying man™s “nal wish to return to Jhark- hand, to the people he loved and with whose struggles he had be- come one for over “ve decades, went unheard. These struggles will keep Father Stan Swamy™s quest for a more democratic India alive.

A familiar air of uncer- tainty surrounds Kabul as the Af- ghans ponder over the future of their land, ravaged by con†ict for nearly 50 years. Afghanistan™s im- mediate neighbours are now faced with a new challenge Š how to per- suade the Taliban against over- playing their military hand? Acostly misadventure Could anyone have predicted when the U.S. commenced its mil- itary intervention in Afghanistan in October 2001 that it would get embroiled in an endless war for 20 years and to exit safely, it would have to negotiate with the Taliban, the same entity that it went in to punish?  It has been a costly lesson. The war e‘ort has cost $980 billion, over 2,400 U.S. soldiers (plus 1,144 allied troops) and 388 private mili- tary contractors have lost their lives. It also spent $143 billion on reconstruction; about $90 billion went for the Afghan army, police and other security forces, $36 bil- lion for governance and economic development activities (the rest of the international community con- tributed an equivalent amount) and the balance on counter-nar- cotics and humanitarian relief works (https://bit.ly/3ADTcP7). Yet, the real price has been paid by the Afghans. The 20-year war has claimed the lives of nearly 50,000 Afghan civilians and near- ly 70,000 Afghan security forces (a majority during the last seven years); add to it another 60,000 Afghan Taliban, and the scale of the Afghan human loss becomes evident.  There have been gains too. In 2001, there were 9,00,000 boys in school. Today, eight million chil- dren attend school and a  third are girls. Literacy is up from 12% in 2002 to 35%; life expectancy from 40 to 63 years. Urbanisation is 26% and 70% of the population watch TV. From 320 miles of paved roads in 2002, today, tarred roads cover 10,000 miles. Infant mortality rates are down from 20% by over half. With a median age of 18.5 years, a majority of Af- ghans have grown up in a post-Ta- liban era. Today, they bear the brunt of 130 daily Taliban/IS Kho- rasan (IS-K)attacks, the highest since the U.S. ended combat oper- ations in end-2014. Tomorrow, even these limited gains are at risk. Taliban gains legitimacy For U.S. President Bush, the objec- tive was ﬁto build a stable, strong, e‘ectively governed Afghanistan that won™t degenerate into chaosﬂ. As the U.S. shifted from counter- terrorism to counter-insurgency, shades of Vietnam began to emerge. To Hamid Karzai™s credit, he saw the writing on the wall when he protested about the night-raids and warned the Ameri- cans ﬁto either take the “ght to the safe havens and sanctuaries across the Durand Line or make peace with the Talibanﬂ but it only soured his relations with the U.S.  Eventually, U.S. President Ba- rack Obama diluted the objective to ﬁpreventing Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for global terrorismﬂ. He oversaw a success- ful operation to eliminate Osama bin Laden in 2011, implemented an unsuccessful military surge concluding with an end to combat operations in end-2014 and Tali- ban opened the Doha ošce in 2013.  U.S. President Donald Trump saw himself as a deal-maker and in 2018, initiated direct negotiations with the Taliban. Ambassador Zal- may Khalilzad (U.S. Special Repre- sentative for Afghanistan Reconci- liation) began by setting out four elements Š a cease“re, cutting ties with al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, intra-Afghan peace talks, and, a withdrawal of all foreign military forces, declaring that ﬁnothing is agreed till everything is agreedﬂ. Within months, the Ta- liban had whittled down the U.S. demands till it got what it wanted Ša withdrawal timeline not linked to the other factors. In addition, the Taliban managed to get the U.S. to push the Kabul government to releaseover 5,000 Taliban cadres in custody. In short, the U.S. ended up legitimising the Tali- ban at the expense of the govern- ment in Kabul that they had worked to create and support. U.S. President Joe Biden was no stranger to the Afghan dossier. He was convinced that the U.S. had to exit from its quagmire of ﬁforever warsﬂ. The U.S. may have decided that it had no military options but the Taliban are still pushing ahead militarily.  From less than a “fth, today, ov- er a third of Afghanistan™s over 400  districts are under Taliban control. The day after the exit from Bagram, 13 districts, in Ba- dakhshan, Takhar, Paktia and Kan- dahar fell to the Taliban, adding to the 50 that have fallen since May. In many cases, the locals manning the security posts and checkpoints have just surrendered. From vil- lages and towns, there is already a move towards the cities. Intra-Af- ghan talks in Doha have been in limbo for months. Questions about the future Gen. Austin S. Miller, the U.S. com- mander in Afghanistan, indicated in a recent press conference, ﬁCivil war is certainly a path that can be visualised if it continues on this trajectory.ﬂ Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, warned on June 30, ﬁThe truth is, today the survival, security and unity of Afghanistan is in danger....ﬂ Ironically, the most vocal critics of the U.S. overstaying in Afghanis- tan and hinting that the U.S. would never leave are the ones now blaming the U.S. for a hasty and ir- responsible withdrawal. In coming months, as uncer- tainties mount, there will be in- creasing Taliban presence in the countryside as the Kabul govern- ment concentrates on ensuring se- curity in urban areas and of the road networks. The Taliban mili- tary strategy has been to target dis- tricts that enable them to sur- round provincial capitals. The clutch in the northeast including Badakhshan, Takhar, Kunduz and Baghlan enable them to control the AfghanistanŒTajikistan border and the Wakhan corridor that links to China. In the east, they ex- ert control in Ghazni, Zabul and Paktia while the Haqqani network is active in Khost and Paktika, and the IS-K in Nangarhar, Kunar and Laghman. Further south, the Tali- ban control large parts of Kanda- har, Helmand and Farah (border- ing Iran).  As the reality of the U.S. with- drawal takes hold, how events un- fold by end-2021 depends on three factors. First, have the Taliban changed their ideological colours? The U.S. in recent years, and Pa- kistan for much longer, have been pushing this line but the Taliban leadership have given no clues about it. Related to this is the ques- tion of Taliban unity. Distances have grown between the Quetta shura, the Doha negotiators and the “ghters who want to guard their individual preserves. This works as long as everyone is pur- suing the military option, but when it comes to power sharing, who calls the shots? Or, does it lead to no power sharing?  Second, can the Kabul regime present a uni“ed front? If the lead- ers in Kabul and the government continue sniping at each other, it will adversely impact the integrity of the chain of command of the Af- ghan security forces. If opportu- nistic leaders are tempted to strike their own deals with the Taliban, it will only hasten the collapse, and even western funding will dry up.  The Pakistan factor Finally, is Pakistan still seeking strategic depth in Afghanistan or has it realised that a Taliban-dom- inated Kabul will be a magnet for its own home-grown extremists as well as those from the neighbour- hood? Can it  persuade the Taliban that its legitimacy will be at risk unless it shares power? Pakistan™s in†uence will weaken once the Rehbari Shura decides to move back from Quetta to Afghanistan.  History tells us that in Afghanis- tan, there have only been winners and losers, seldom any lasting compromises.  Rakesh Sood is a former diplomat and presently, Distinguished Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation Troubling prospects in Afghanistan As the reality of the U.S. withdrawal takes hold, the future will depend on Taliban-Kabul dynamics and Pakistan™s role  Rakesh Sood REUTERSEntering its “fth year, India™s Goods and Services Tax (GST) system reported a blip in revenue col- lections for June, breaking an eight-month streak of over 1-lakh crore in tax receipts. GST revenues tanked to a tad less than93,000 crore last month Š the lowest in 10months Š after a record1.41-lakh crore in April and  a relatively tepid1.02-lakh crore in May. Gen- erally, the June revenue re†ects transactions that oc- curred in May. With the second wave of the pandemic in full †ourish and States enforcing rigorous restrictions on most activities in May, the numbers are not really surprising. However, as May GST compliance dates for smaller taxpayers were extended till early July, some of this revenue also re†ects April™s sales . Thus, the actual GST income attributable to May™s economic activity would be lower than June™s gross GST kitty. This is also re†ected in the generation of e-way bills, which fell by a sharp 30% in May compared to April, while the sequen- tial decline in revenues was not as steep. With caseloads declining over June and restrictions being pulled ba ck gradually, revenues should pick up next month with 5.5 crore e-way bills generated in June from 3.99 crore in May. Despite the slowdown in May-June, GST collec- tions in the Q1 of  2021-22  have been healthier than pre- pandemic levels, con“rming that this year™s restrictions driven by States have in†icted less economic costs than the national lockdown at a few hours™ notice, in 2020.  While the second wave setbacks have shaken up bu- siness and consumer sentiment, average monthly reve- nues of over 1-lakh crore Š which Finance Minister Nir- mala Sitharaman has termed the ‚new normal™ for GST Šcould perhaps sustain through the year, if there is no dramatic resurgence of the pandemic and vaccinations are ramped up as promised. This should give some “s- cal breathing room for the Centre and States, but neith- er can a‘ord to sit back. Structural corrections in the GST regime and the inclusion of petroleum and elec- tricity may take longer, but there is enough that needs immediate attention. Industry has sought temporary rate cuts on some sectors to spur demand. It is plausible that a volume pick-up could make up for resultant reve- nue losses, just as an uptick in petrol consumption creates room for a revenue-neutral duty cut on fuels. The GST Council must be reconvened soon to take up such ideas to prod the economy™s rebound, apart from holding the promised special session to discuss all  the brewing concerns related to States™ compensation. De- laying this will not only foster greater misgivings bet- ween the Centre and the Statesbut also make it tough for States to plan their borrowings for the rest of the year. Clarity is also needed urgently on when the 1.58-lakh crore of back-to-back borrowings for States in lieu of compensation dues will begin. If the Centre plans to raise  5,000 crore a week, like it did last year, it will take roughly 32 weeks to complete such borrowings; so, any delay beyond early August may not be viable.  A blip This year™s restrictions by States have in†icted less economic costs than the 2020 lockdown The reconstitution of the Union Council of Minis- ters on Wednesday was guided by both political and administrative considerations. As many as 36 new faces were inducted and 12 dropped from the council, which now has 78 members, just three shy of the upper limit of 81. In 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) began its rule advertising its 45-member C ouncil of M inisters as an attempt at minimum government, but the restraint was quietly abandoned in the following years. The political aspirations of communities and re- gions are dišcult to satiate in a country as vast and di- verse as India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made an attempt to make his Council more diverse and repre- sentative, in a manner that “ts his political prioriti es. The new composition of the Council is in step with the BJP™s relentless e‘orts to rope in OBC groups, Dalits and tribes people under its Hindutva umbrella politics. This accommodation is crucial for the BJP to continue its do- minance in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other Hindi-speak- ing regions, where caste tensions are simmering. New inductions and elevations also signal a continued e‘ort by the BJP to expand its in†uence to new areas such as West Bengal and the northeastern States. Barring the continuing under-representation of Muslims, the coun- cil is impressively representative of Indian diversity.  Governance issues might have been a factor in the ax- ing of some of the Ministers. Harsh Vardhan, Ravi Shan- kar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar were among those who got the marching orders, apparently for mishan- dling the pandemic, relations with global IT giants and governmental communication, respectively. New in- ductees such as Ashwini Vaishnaw and Jyotiraditya Scindia have administrative skills that could prove  va- luable in crucial ministries that they now head. Ind ivi- dual talent and accountability both can only be contex- tual, and in a highly centralised system they become immaterial. The M inisters must be empowered to plan and take decisions in their respective areas. The notion of collective responsibility of the cabinet must be i n- fused with meaning. Discussions in the cabinet must be open. Proposals that come for the cabinet™s consider a- tion must go through rigorous technical vetting and wide political consultations. The recomposition was in- tended to enhance governance, rev up the economy and fuel the BJP™s political march ahead of crucial State elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. All thes ewould be possible only if all hands are on the deck. As- sembling a team is indeed a crucial task of a captain; al- lowing them to †ourish as individuals while playing as a team is equally critical.  New phase  Cabinet shu“e aims to improve governance while keeping in mind political considerations This PDF was originally uploaded To The  English Newspaper L-- Banna SA (https://t.me/English_Newspaper_L_Banna)one else Backup chennal @NEWS_Backup_L_Banna
